Remote Control of Things ver2

RCoT (Remote Control of Things) is a project to create an app that manipulates TVs, set-top boxes and audio on behalf of Remote Controls. 
If you register the desired remote control with the RCoT app, you can operate corresponding electronic products such as TV and audio through the app. 
For example, an app can raise or lower the volume of audio on a TV. Or you can turn on or search TV channels with just one app.
